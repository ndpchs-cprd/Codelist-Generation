# **Comprehensive Medical Codelist Management System**

## Description
This project provides a suite of tools for researchers and healthcare professionals to manage and utilize medical codelists effectively. It integrates multiple sources, including the NHS PCD refset, HDRUK phenotype library, AIM RSF codelists, CALIBER project codelists, and Opencodelists.org, facilitating robust search capabilities and conversion to proprietary formats like CPRD Aurum's MedCodeIDs. These tools streamline the process of defining conditions, diseases, treatments, and medications for data extraction and research purposes.

## Features
* Codelist Searcher: Search through multiple pre-existing codelists using disease or condition names.
* Codelist Converter: Convert standard SNOMED codelists to CPRD Aurum-specific MedCodeIDs.
* EMIS Dictionary Searcher: Perform advanced searches on the EMIS medical dictionary to locate similar terms using a variety of techniques.
