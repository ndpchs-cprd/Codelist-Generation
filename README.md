# **Comprehensive Medical Codelist Management System**

## Description
This project provides tools for researchers and healthcare professionals to make CPRD medical codelists effectively and efficiently. It integrates codelists from multiple sources, including the NHS PCD refset, HDRUK phenotype library, AIM RSF codelists, CALIBER project codelists, and Opencodelists.org. It also offers search capabilities with relavent terms for the creation of new codelists and the option to combine these with existing codelists.  These tools streamline the process of defining conditions, diseases, treatments, and medications for data extraction and research purposes. The tool gives you the option to create codelists of SNOMED CT Concept IDs, CPRD Aurum Medcode IDs or both.

## Features
* Codelist Searcher: Search through repositories described above using disease or condition names.
* Codelist Converter: Convert standard SNOMED codelists to CPRD Aurum-specific MedCodeIDs.
* EMIS Dictionary Searcher: Perform tailored searches on the EMIS medical dictionary using relevant search terms. Options include exact match, partial match, starts with, ends with, and/or, and exlude.
